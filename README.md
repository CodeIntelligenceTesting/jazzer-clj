# Fuzzing Clojure code with [Jazzer](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer)

The goal of `jazzer-clj` is to provide an idiomatic way to test Clojure software
with the JVM fuzzer [Jazzer](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer).
See
[jazzer-clojure-example](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer-clojure-example)
for an example project using it, or follow the instructions below to set it up
with your own code.

## Usage

In order to test your code, Jazzer requires you to write so-called "fuzz
targets" for it. They're comparable to unit tests, but with one important
difference: fuzz targets need to use input data that they receive from the
fuzzer to exercise the code under test.

For a concrete example, let's assume you have a function `do-something` that
takes an integer and a string argument. In order to test it with Jazzer, define
a fuzz target like so:

``` clojure
;; Anywhere in your code, as long as the namespace is AOT-compiled (see below)
(ns your-company.your-project.somewhere
  (:require [com.code-intelligence.jazzer-clj.core :as fuzzing]))

;; The function under test can be defined in this namespace or another; let's
;; assume it's defined like this:
(defn do-something
  "Not a very useful piece of code."
  [x s]
  (when (and (= 42 x)
             (= "supersecret" s))
    (throw (Exception. "You found the bug!"))))

;; Now we define the actual test:
(fuzzing/deftarget your.company.fuzzing.DoSomethingTarget [input]
  (do-something (.consumeInt input) (.consumeRemainingAsString input)))
```

Internally, this defines a Java class with the interface required by Jazzer
(expand the macro if you're curious!). Think of the `input` parameter as a
source of test data; see the
[javadoc](https://codeintelligencetesting.github.io/jazzer-api/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/api/FuzzedDataProvider.html)
for details.

Now you can build a JAR from your project as usual (e.g., using `lein uberjar`).
What's important is to make sure that all namespaces containing fuzz targets
(i.e., `your-company.your-project.somewhere` in our example) are AOT-compiled:
Jazzer requires the class that you define with `deftarget` to exist when the
code is loaded. In Leiningen, for example, you achieve this by putting the
following into your `project.clj`:

``` clojure
(defproject ...
  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
```

Assuming you've produced the JAR in `target/your-project.jar`, you can run
Jazzer using the Docker image that the project provides:

``` shell
docker run -v $PWD:/fuzzing cifuzz/jazzer                       \
       --cp=/fuzzing/target/your-project.jar                    \
       --target-class=your.company.fuzzing.DoSomethingTarget    \
       /fuzzing/corpus-do-something
```

Note how the command tells Jazzer the class name of the target that you've
defined with `deftarget`. The last argument is optional but recommended; it
tells Jazzer to write interesting program inputs to the specified directory, so
that you can resume fuzzing at a later time or run multiple fuzzers in parallel
and have them share their knowledge.

If everything is set up correctly, Jazzer should print some notes about the code
that it's instrumenting, and then start fuzzing your function:

``` text

```

The fuzzer will stop if it finds a crash and print details of the discovered
issue.
